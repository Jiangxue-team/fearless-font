# Introduce
The Fearless font is a Chinese calligraphy font that features strong brushstrokes and is named "Fearless" to convey a sense of cultural confidence and to inspire similar groups of people. Therefore, the Fearless font supports not only Chinese but also several letters in English and other languages.

## Contributing
As a font, we will improve and provide more commonly used characters in the future, so that interested parties can participate in the design of the font.
